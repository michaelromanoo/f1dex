# F1dex

F1dex is a simple website that uses an external [Formula 1 API](http://ergast.com/mrd/) to display data in a simpler & easier way.
For now, the website only displays driver & constructor information.

## Installation & Usage

To view the deployed website, you can visit the website [here](https://f1dex.vercel.app/).

To run the project locally, run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:michaelromanoo/f1dex.git

# Change into repository
$ cd f1dex

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the site
$ npm start
```

## Future Goals

Add more filter options such as:

- View all drivers for a given team in a given year
- View driver standings in a given year
